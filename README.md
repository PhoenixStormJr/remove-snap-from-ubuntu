# remove-snap-from-ubuntu
This script removes snapd from Ubuntu, AND installs .debs of firefox and chromium, AND it works across updates

WARNING: This is mainly untested! It may break Ubuntu, as it uses Linux Mint repositories to install firefox and chromium! I DO NOT KNOW what this will cause. I used a virtual machine to test it.
